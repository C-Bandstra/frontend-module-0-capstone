      <p class="one">I am 20 years old and probably the youngest out of everyone in the class. I may have less life
        experience but please dont mistake this for complete ignorance. I work best in a group setting
        allowing everyone to bounce ideas off eachother. This way of working is great for creating the
        best solution for each problem. To obtain the best solution, I ask you to outright tell me
        when I am wrong.

    <p class="one">I moved to Denver about 10 months ago and I am amazed by how many things there
       are to do here! I grew up in a small town of Iowa, so my interests were limited to working
       on the farm, highschool sports, and women. Since I have been living here I have been near
       the mountains at all times. I have been able to snowboard whenever I want, instead of doing
       it during the busiest times of the year. I have also been introduced to climbing although
       I am not very good, it is an absolute blast. Having access to the beautiful scenery is
       always a plus. Since graduated highschool last year, I have also taken up playing the guitar.
       It's always exciting to learn new chord progressions and songs. It is an endless hobby just
       like computer programmming!

    <p class="two">Since moving here, I have also taken a great interest in philosphy,
        specifically Eastern. There is something about gaining access to the way everything around
        us works together and why, that gets my blood flowing. I am very embarrassed to say I cannot
        do drugs and alcohol like a normal person. I have decided to be sober because of how much
        I destroy my life on substances. Since deciding this, I have been able to gain control back
        I had thought was impossible. Turing is giving me the chance to make my life great and I am
        beyond excited to learn the language of devices we use everyday.

      <p class="three">Module 0 has been a huge learning experience. I was really nervous going into this,
         thinking I wasnt going to understand anything. The amount of resources available
         were great in getting the hang of things.I focused on enhacing my productivity
         because I was lacking in that area by a long shot. Here are some of the resources
         I used to to do so and if you havent used them i'd give them a shot.</p>
