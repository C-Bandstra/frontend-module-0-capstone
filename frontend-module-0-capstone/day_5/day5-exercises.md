Statements, Variables, Datas Types, and Arrays
1. Variables are the storage place for bits of information a script needs to do its task. An equals sign in javascript says that you are going to assign the variable a value. This is called an assignment operator.
1. The numeric data type handles numbers, it uses numbers from 0-9. The string data type consists of letters and certain characters, it is enclosed in quotes. The boolean data type can have one of two values: true or false.
1. Six rules when naming variables
    1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore.
    1. You must not use a dash or period in a variable name.
    1. You must not use keywords or reserved words.
    1. All variables are case sensitive. This being so, it is still bad practice to create variables with the same name and different case.
    1. Use a name that describes the information that is stored inside the variable.
    1. Use camel case when two or more words is needed for a variable name. Dashes and periods are unacceptable.
1. Arrays are especially useful when you have an unknown amount of items in your list. To access an array, you should specify the number of the item within the list inside square brackets. To change the value of an item inside an array, you should select and assign it a new value using an equals sign and new value.
1. A statement is roughly an instruction that controls or performs actions but it does not resolve them. An expression is valid code that gives the results in a value.
1. Three types of operators
    1. Assignment operators assign a value to a variable.
    1. Arithmetic operators perform simple math equations.
    1. String operators combine two strings in sequence.
